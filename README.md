# Functional-ML

## Current foci
### Understanding Haskell better by coding multicategories 
*Exploring Haskell by representing various configuration-based, [Beilinson/Drinfeld-style pseudo-tensor categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_algebra), a.k.a. [multicategories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicategory).*

### Understanding Haskell better by coding behavior-based OOP
The adoption of category theory as a foundational language for mathematics, during the latter half of the 20th century, marks a move from a "sets with added structure," *Substantialist* picture of mathematical entities, to a "object with universal properties," *Structuralist* picture of mathematical entities. The "sets with added structure" is captured pretty well in OOP. If we're doing a really strict version of functional programming with Haskell, then we're taking the opposite, structuralist perspective. Acknowledging the way that category theory absorbed set theory in many parts of mathematics, for instance in [Lawvere and Tierney's work on topoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_topos_theory).
